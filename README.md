# Basic OpenGL Application with Win32
A basic OpenGL application, developed with no external libraries and windowing done with Win32 API.

## Description
A very basic application that renders a triangle, a line, and a square with different colors assigned to each vertex. Features different window types, window styles, fullscreen and windowed mode, keyboard input, MessageBoxes, double frame buffering, pixel format descriptor practice, and more.

## Screenshots
When you first run the app, the *WM_CREATE* message is captured and we display this MessageBox

After you accept the first MessageBox, the application opens automatically in fullscreen

### Special Thanks
Special acknowledgement given to my tutor Aditya Boob, who helped me develop and understand the intricacies of Win32. I'm still a little new to OpenGL and Win32, but so far I love graphics programming and am constantly learning :)
